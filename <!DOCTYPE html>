			<p>Since it was formed in 1983, MPD (formerly Musicians Against Nuclear Arms) has donated over £50,000 to organisations within the peace movement. Many leading conductors, soloists, orchestral players and chamber musicians have taken part in our fund-raising concerts, with everyone giving their services. At most events a speaker is invited to give a short address. As well as our musical activities, we produce a quarterly newsletter. MPD’s President is the distinguished guitarist John Williams, and a number of well-known figures from all branches of music feature in the list of Patrons. MPD is affiliated to CND and The Network for Peace. Membership is open to anyone with an interest in music and a desire to further the cause of peace. If you would like to join, or to be kept informed of MPD events, please contact: <a href="info.mpdconcerts@gmail.com ">info.mpdconcerts@gmail.com</a></p>
